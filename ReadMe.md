Welcome to PHP.Gt â€” a lightweight application development toolkit aimed at streamlining development and respecting web technologies.

PHP frameworks offer many features, and often come with steep learning curves. The motivation behind PHP.Gt is the belief that what a framework can offer can be achieved by **eliminating code rather than adding more**.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BrightFlair/PHP.Gt.svg?branch=v2)](https://travis-ci.org/BrightFlair/PHP.Gt)

PHP.Gt has been in commercial use for 2 years now. It is now time for a full code re-write to bring it up to speed with the industry and to apply what we've learnt over the years.

**Version 2 (this working branch) is backwards breaking and unfinished. Do not use this on real projects!**
