Welcome to the PHP.Gt webengine â€” a lightweight PHP 7 application development toolkit aimed at streamlining development and respecting web technologies.

PHP frameworks offer many features, but often come with steep learning curves or imposing rules. The motivation behind this project is the belief that what a framework can offer can be achieved by **eliminating code rather than adding more**.

Current project status.
=======================

> **WARNING!** This repository is undergoing a major rewrite to version 3. Most of the code is being extracted into its own repositories under the phpgt organisation.

View the detailed [project roadmap on Trello](https://php.gt/trello) to see what's coming up, and what's made its way into recent releases.

The most important changes are:

+ Extracting all modules of functionality into their own Composer packages.
+ Gaining full PHP 7 support.
+ Full code coverage.

Features at a glance.
---------------------

+ Pages made dynamic via server-side DOM Document access.
+ HTML templating.
+ Database abstraction.
+ Create web pages or web services (APIs) with the same code.
+ Use preprocessor languages (SCSS, HAML, etc.) with zero configuration.
+ Web security as standard.
+ Strong separation of concerns over PHP, HTML, SQL, JavaScript, CSS.
+ Preconfigured PHPUnit and Behat test environment.
+ Workflow tools to quickly create, integrate and deploy projects.

Essential concepts.
-------------------

### Static first.

To lower the barrier of entry to web development, the technique of developing a static prototype first is promoted, dropping in logic when and where necessary to turn prototypes into fully functional production code with as few steps as possible.

### Build using tech you already know.

The main idea is to provide a platform where you can get as much done, using standard tech you've already learnt. Technologies that make up the [world wide web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), such as HTML and HTTP, are respected and enhanced by bringing useful tools and techniques to you, the developer.

### Drop in tools without any fuss.

There are a lot of useful tools included as standard, such as [SCSS parsing](https://github.com/phpgt/webengine/wiki/Client-side-files), [HTML templating](https://github.com/phpgt/webengine/wiki/Templating) and [CSRF handling](https://github.com/phpgt/webengine/wiki/CSRF), but the highly modularised architecture keeps compatibility high. Packages from [Packagist](https://packagist.org) can be installed and loaded with zero configuration.

### Develop locally or virtually.

Preconfigured scripts are available to automatically set up local servers or virtualisation environments to get you going as quickly as possible, without having to change existing computer configuration.

### Community of blueprints.

To get projects going with full momentum, blueprint projects are available to base your projects off. Blueprints come with just enough level of design and functionality to get a prototype out the door as quickly as possible, without prescribing anything.
