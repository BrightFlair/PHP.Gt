 * @property-read string $accept_charset Character sets that are acceptable
 * @property-read string $accept_encoding List of acceptable encodings
 * @property-read string $accept_language List of acceptable human languages 
 * for response
 * @property-read string $accept_datetime Acceptable version in time
 * @property-read string $authorization Authentication credentials for HTTP 
 * authentication
 * @property-read string $cache_control Used to specify directives that MUST be 
 * obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain
 * @property-read string $connection What type of connection the user-agent
 * would prefer
 * @property-read string $cookie an HTTP cookie previously sent by the server 
 * with Set-Cookie
 * @property-read string $content_length The length of the request body in 
 * octets (8-bit bytes)
 * @property-read string $content_md5 A Base64-encoded binary MD5 sum of the
 * content of the request body
 * @property-read string $content_type The MIME type of the body of the request
 * (used with POST and PUT requests)
 * @property-read string $date The date and time that the message was sent (in 
 * "HTTP-date" format as defined by RFC 7231)
 * @property-read string $expect Indicates that particular server behaviors are
 * required by the client
 * @property-read string $from The email address of the user making the request
 * @property-read string $host The domain name of the server (for virtual 
 * hosting), and the TCP port number on which the server is listening. The port 
 * number may be omitted if the port is the standard port for the service 
 * requested
 * @property-read string $if_match Only perform the action if the client 
 * supplied entity matches the same entity on the server. This is mainly for 
 * methods like PUT to only update a resource if it has not been modified 
 * since the user last updated it
 * @property-read string $if_modified_since Allows a 304 Not Modified to be 
 * returned if content is unchanged
 * @property-read string $if_none_match Allows a 304 Not Modified to be 
 * returned if content is unchanged
 * @property-read string $if_range If the entity is unchanged, send me the

 * @property-read string $if_unmodified_since Only send the response if the

 * @property-read string $max_forwards Limit the number of times the message 
 * can be forwarded through proxies or gateways

 * various effects anywhere along the request-response chain
 * @property-read string $proxy_authorization Authorization credentials for
 * connecting to a proxy
 * @property-read string $range Request only part of an entity. Bytes are
 * numbered from 0
 * @property-read string $referer This is the address of the previous web page 
 * from which a link to the currently requested page was followed. (The word 
 * "referrer" has been misspelled in the RFC as well as in most implementations
 * to the point that it has become standard usage and is considered correct
 * terminology)
 * @property-read string $te The transfer encodings the user agent is willing
 * to accept
 * @property-read string $user_agent The user agent string of the user agent
 * @property-read string $upgrade Ask the server to upgrade to another protocol
 * @property-read string $via Informs the server of proxies through which the 
 * request was sent
 * @property-read string $warning A general warning about possible problems
