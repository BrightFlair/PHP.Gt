# Rapid development engine for PHP 7 applications.

Welcome to the PHP.Gt webengine â€” a lightweight PHP 7 application development toolkit aimed at streamlining development and respecting web technologies.

PHP frameworks offer many features, but often come with steep learning curves or imposing rules. The motivation behind this project is the belief that what a framework can offer can be achieved by **eliminating code rather than adding more**.

Essential concepts
------------------

### Static first

To increase development speed and lower the barrier to getting an idea prototyped, the technique of developing a static prototype first is promoted, dropping in logic when and where necessary to turn prototypes into fully functional production code with as few steps as possible.  

### Build using tech you already know

The main idea is to provide a platform where you can get as much done, using standard tech you've already learnt. Technologies that make up the [world wide web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), such as HTML and HTTP, are respected and enhanced by bringing useful tools and techniques to you, the developer.

### Drop in tools without any fuss

There are a lot of useful tools included as standard, such as [SCSS parsing](https://github.com/phpgt/webengine/wiki/Client-side-files), [HTML templating](https://github.com/phpgt/webengine/wiki/Templating) and [CSRF handling](https://github.com/phpgt/webengine/wiki/CSRF), but the highly modularised architecture keeps compatibility high. Packages from [Packagist](https://packagist.org) can be installed and loaded with zero configuration.

### Develop locally or virtually

Preconfigured scripts are available to automatically set up local servers or virtualisation environments to get you going as quickly as possible, without having to change existing computer configuration.

### Community of blueprints

To get projects going with full momentum, blueprint projects are available to base your projects off. Blueprints come with just enough level of design and functionality to get a prototype out the door as quickly as possible, without prescribing anything.
